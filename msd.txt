Mahendra Singh Dhoni, commonly known as MS Dhoni or simply Dhoni, is a former Indian international cricketer and one of the most successful cricket captains in history. Born on July 7, 1981, in Ranchi, Jharkhand, Dhoni is renowned for his calm demeanor, exceptional leadership skills, and remarkable ability to finish matches.

Dhoni made his international debut for India in December 2004 in an ODI against Bangladesh. He quickly rose to prominence with his aggressive batting style and sharp wicket-keeping skills. Dhoni became the captain of the Indian cricket team in 2007, leading India to numerous victories, including the ICC T20 World Cup in 2007, the ICC Cricket World Cup in 2011, and the ICC Champions Trophy in 2013.

Under Dhoni's captaincy, India achieved the number one ranking in Test cricket for the first time in December 2009. He is known for his strategic acumen on the field, often making bold decisions under pressure. Dhoni's finishing abilities, particularly in limited-overs cricket, earned him the nickname "Captain Cool" and made him a fan favorite worldwide.

In addition to his success as a captain, Dhoni is also one of the most accomplished wicket-keepers and batsmen in cricket history. He holds several records, including the most dismissals by an Indian wicket-keeper in Test cricket and the most international stumpings by any wicket-keeper.

After a successful international career spanning over 15 years, Dhoni announced his retirement from international cricket on August 15, 2020. Despite stepping away from the international stage, Dhoni continues to be involved in cricket as the captain of the Chennai Super Kings in the Indian Premier League (IPL) and remains a revered figure in Indian cricket.
